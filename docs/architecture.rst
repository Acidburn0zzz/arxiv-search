arXiv Search
************

Context
=======

The arXiv search system provides a faceted search experience to arXiv readers,
as a part of the core arXiv website. Readers can search by specific metadata
fields, and by full-text content. The search system also supports future
development to improve relevance, paper suggestions (e.g. based on the paper
that the reader is currently viewing), and suggestions based on reading
history.

The search system also provides programmatic access to arXiv metadata via
the API Gateway. API consumers can perform complex searches via RESTful APIs.
Resources provided by the API are linked to resources provided by other APIs
in the arXiv system, to facilitate discovery.

Finally, the search system acts as a secondary data store for some other arXiv
subsystems within the :ref:`enhancement & discovery area of concern
<enhancement-and-discovery>`. For example, the RSS feed API.

The search system subscribes to notifications about new publications and
full text content.
