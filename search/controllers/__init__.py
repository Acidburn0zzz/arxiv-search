"""
Houses controllers for search.

Each controller corresponds to a distinct search feature with its own request
handling logic. Each controller API exposes a ``search()`` function that
accepts a set of request parameters (``dict``-like) and returns a 3-tuple
of response data (``dict``), status code (``int``), and extra response headers
(``dict``).
