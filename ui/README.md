#UI Reference Documents

Source files will be accompanied by PDF or image files that are generically readable with the same naming conventions.

**Workflow documents** are intended to be a visualization of the screens and actions that a user would take to perform a specific task (or complete a user story).

**Wireframe documents** are very simple layout structures to help define the overall structure of a page, and inform prototypes. They are meant to provide a high-level overview, define regions, and prompt discussion of necessary details.

**Prototype documents** are the working documents in which every detail of the designed interface should be represented, and from which interface elements can be fully built.
