We demonstrate an electromechanical graphene varactor, a variable capacitor wherein the capacitance is tuned by voltage controlled deflection of a dense array of suspended graphene membranes. The low flexural rigidity of graphene monolayers is exploited to achieve low actuation voltage in an ultra-thin structure. Large arrays comprising thousands of suspensions were fabricated to give a tunable capacitance of over 10 pF/mm$^2$, higher than that achieved by traditional micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) technologies. A capacitance tuning of 55% was achieved with a 10 V actuating voltage, exceeding that of conventional MEMS parallel plate capacitors. Capacitor behavior was investigated experimentally, and described by a simple theoretical model. Mechanical properties of the graphene membranes were measured independently using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM).
