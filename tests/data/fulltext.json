Hora4\n\nAccepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal\n\nABSTRACT\nWe estimate flux ratios of the extrasolar planet XO-1b to its host star XO-1 at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8.0\nmicrons with the IRAC on the Spitzer Space Telescope to be 0.00086 ± 0.00007, 0.00122 ± 0.00009,\n0.00261 ± 0.00031 and 0.00210 ± 0.00029, respectively. The fluxes are inconsistent with a canonical\ncloudless model for the thermal emission from a planet and suggest an atmosphere with a thermal\ninversion layer and a possible stratospheric absorber. A newly emerging correlation between the\npresence of a thermal inversion layer in the planetary atmosphere and stellar insolation of the planet\n(Burrows et al. 2007b) is refined. The sub-stellar point flux from the parent star at XO-1b of ∼ 0.49\n× 109 erg cm −2 s −1 sets a new lower limit for the occurrence of a thermal inversion in a planetary\natmosphere.\nSubject headings: stars:individual(XO-1) - binaries:eclipsing - infrared:stars - planetary systems\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nOver 270 extrasolar planets have been reported,\nmore than 30 of which transit their primary star5 .\nIn addition to the mass, radius and inclination of\nthe planet evident from transits, atmospheric com-\nposition can also be studied through transmission\nspectroscopy,\nleading to detections of sodium, water\nand methane (Charbonneau et al. 2002; Tinetti et al.\n2007; Swain et al. 2008).\nIn addition,\nsecondary\neclipse observations provide broadband emission spectra\n(Knutson et al. 2008; Charbonneau et al. 2008), plane-\ntary brightness temperatures (Charbonneau et al. 2005;\nDeming et al. 2005; Harrington et al. 2007) and even\nday-night temperature contrast (Knutson et al. 2007).\nTorres et al. (2008) provide a reanalysis of light curves\nand RV measurements of all then known transiting\nplanets.\n\n8\n0\n0\n2\n\ny\n\na\n\nM\n\n6\n1\n\n]\n\nh\np\n\n-\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\ns\n\na\n\n[\n\n1\nv\n8\n1\n4\n2\n\n.\n\n5\n0\n8\n0\n\n:\n\nv\n\ni\n\nX\n\nr\n\na\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f2\n\nMachalek et al.\n\n1b (McCullough et al. 2006) in all 4 IRAC channels\nobtained during secondary eclipses with the IRAC of\n\nSpitzer Space Telescope. By comparing our ∼ 4-8 μm\n\nSED with atmospheric models, we test for the presence\nof a thermal inversion layer in XO-1b.\n\n2. OBSERVATIONS\n\nThe InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC; Fazio et al. 2004)\nhas a field of view of 5.2′ × 5.2′ in each of its four bands.\nTwo adjacent fields are imaged in pairs (3.6 and 5.8 mi-\ncrons; 4.5 and 8.0 microns). The detector arrays each\nmeasure 256 × 256 pixels, with a pixel size of approx-\nimately 1.22′′ × 1.22′′ . We have observed XO-1 in all\n4 channels in two separate Astronomical Observing Re-\nquests (AORs) in two different sessions: the 4.5 and 8.0\nmicron channels for 5.9 hours on UT 2007 April 02 (AOR\n21374464) and the 3.6 and 5.8 micron channels for 5.9\nhours on UT 2007 Aug 10 (AOR 21374208). We used\nthe 12 s frame time, obtaining 1620 full-array images in\neach bandpass with a cadence of 13.2 s and an effective\nintegration time of 10.4 s . The pointing was not dithered\nand was selected such that for the Apr 2007 observations\nin the 4.5 and 8.0 micron channels, two bright calibra-\ntors for XO-1 (2MASS J16021184+2810105 J=9.939 J -\nK =0.412) were used: 2MASS J16021795+2813328: J =\n9.913 J - K = 0.564 and 2MASS J16020133+2809268:\nJ = 12.542 J - K = 0.795. The Aug 2007 observations\nin the 3.6 and 5.8 micron channels used 2 bright cali-\nbrators: 2MASS J16021311+2809004: J=11.045 J - K =\n0.652 and 2MASS J16020133+2809268: J = 12.542 J -\nK = 0.795.\nWe used the standard IRAC Basic Calibrated Data\nproducts (version 16.1) described in the Spitzer Data\nHandbook6 , which includes dark frame subtraction, mul-\ntiplexer bleed correction, detector linearization, and\nflat-fielding of the images. We converted the times\nrecorded by the spacecraft in the FITS file header key-\nword DATE-OBS to heliocentric Julian dates using the\norbital ephemeris of the spacecraft provided by the Hori-\nzons Ephemeris System7 .\nPrior to performing aperture photometry, we resam-\npled the images in all four channels to a 10 times finer\ngrid in each spatial direction using flux-conserving bi-\nlinear interpolation (similar to Harrington et al. (2007)).\nWith the implementation for aperture photometry that\nwe used, resampling makes a marginal improvement in\nthe photometry, i.e. a slightly lower r.m.s. of out-of-\neclipse points, presumably related to how the routine\nhandles fractional pixels at the edge of the aperture.\nThe zodiacal background was subtracted in each\nchannel by constructing a histogram of all pixels in each\nimage and fitting a Gaussian to the distribution of the\nzodiacal background brightness. A constant mean value\nof the Gaussian was then subtracted from each pixel in\nthe image to construct a background-subtracted image.\nThe centroids of XO-1 and the 2 calibrators were evalu-\nated by fitting a Gaussian to the stellar flux distribution.\nThe pointing varied by 0.3 pixel, and the shifting of the\nstellar centroid within a pixel, which have sub-pixel sen-\nsitivity variations, resulted in a modulation of the stellar\nflux in the 3.6 and 4.5 micron channels (described below).\n\n6 http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/irac/dh/\n7 http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/\n\nAperture photometry was then performed on the im-\nages with an aperture radius of 4 pixels, which was found\nto be the optimum value for all 4 channels. The size\nof the aperture was determined by minimizing the rms\nscatter in the light curve for observations outside of the\neclipse. Apertures smaller than 4 pixels contained insuf-\nficient stellar flux and larger apertures were more con-\ntaminated by the sky (especially in the high background\nsignal of the 5.8 and 8.0 micron channels). An appro-\npriate aperture correction for each channel was applied\nto the stellar flux value according to the Spitzer Data\nHandbook of [1.112, 1.113, 1.125, 1.218] for the [3.6; 4.5;\n5.8 and 8.0] micron channels, respectively. The σ of the\nout-of-eclipse points was calculated iteratively using 3-σ\noutlier rejection at each step until no more points were\nrejected. To remove cosmic rays the resultant robust σ\nwas used to reject entire images which contain the 3-σ\noutliers above and below the mean of the light curve.\n1.4%; 1.9%; 3.0 %, 2.4 % of images from the 3.6, 4.5,\n5.8 and 8.0 micron channels, respectively, were removed\nin this fashion. The higher rejection rate in the two red-\nder channels is consistent with a higher number of cosmic\nray-affected pixels in these channels (Patten et al. 2004).\nThroughout the analysis we have preserved flux units.\n\n2.1. 3.6 and 4.5 micron time series\n\nThe 3.6-μm time series exhibited a sharp increase dur-\ning the first ∼30 minutes of exposure for XO-1 and the\n2 calibrators, presumably as a result of the instrument\nreaching a new equilibrium after previous observations.\nSuch relaxation effects can reach several percent and usu-\nally stabilize within the first hour of observations of a new\ntarget. We have ignored the first 125 points (∼30 min)\nin the 3.6-μm time series in addition to the high-sigma\noutlier rejection as described in the previous section.\nA strong correlation between the sub-pixel centroid\nand stellar brightness was observed in both the 3.6-\nμm and 4.5-μm channels, with flux magnitudes of ∼\n0.6% and 0.8%, respectively. This well studied effect\n(Charbonneau et al. 2005; Morales-Calder ́on et al. 2006)\nis due to the InSb detector intrapixel sensitivity vari-\nations as the spacecraft jitters ∼0.3 arcsec in orienta-\ntion over a period of ∼3000 seconds 8 . The uncorrected\nsub-pixel intensity variations are clearly visible in the\ntime series of XO-1 in the 3.6-μm and 4.5-μm channels\nin Fig. 1. We have corrected for this sub-pixel intensity\nvariations after Charbonneau et al. (2008) by fitting a\nquadratic function to the photometric flux points of XO-\n1b observed out-of-eclipse as a function of the x and y\nsub-pixel centroids:\n\nIsubpixel = b1+ b2× x + b3× x2 + b4× y + b5 × y 2 , (1)\n\nwhere x and y are the subpixel centroids of center of\nlight of the star and bn are the fit parameters. The rms\nresidual of the XO-1 time series for points outside of the\neclipse after correction for the sub-pixel intensity vari-\nation was 0.0020, which is 18% higher than a theoret-\nical estimate of XO-1 Poisson noise based on detector\n\n8 http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/documents/exoplanetmemo.txt\n\n\fXO-1b Thermal emission\n\n3\n\n3.6 micron\n3.6 micron\n3.6 micron\n3.6 micron\n\n4.5 micron\n4.5 micron\n4.5 micron\n4.5 micron\n\n5.8 micron\n5.8 micron\n5.8 micron\n5.8 micron\n\n8.0 micron\n8.0 micron\n8.0 micron\n8.0 micron\n\n1.010\n\n1.000\n\n0.990\n\n0.980\n\n0.970\n\n0.960\n\n0.950\n\n0.940\n\n0.930\n\nt\n\nn\na\n\nt\n\ns\nn\no\nc\n\n+\n\nx\nu\n\nl\nf\n\ne\nv\n\ni\nt\n\na\ne\n\nl\n\nR\n\n0.920\n-0.15\n\n-0.10\n-0.05\n-0.00\n0.05\n0.10\nTime from predicted eclipse center (days)\n\n0.15\n\nFig. 1.- Secondary eclipse observations of XO-1b with\nIRAC on Spitzer Space Telescope obtained on UT 2007 April\n02 and UT 2007 Aug 10 in 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8.0 micron chan-\nnels (from top to bottom) binned in 6-minute interval and\nnormalized to 1 and offset by 0.02 for clarity. The overplot-\nted solid lines do not represent a fit to the data, but rather\nshow the correction for the detector effects. The 3.6 and 4.6\nmicron time series are decorelated using XO-1 out-of-eclipse\npoints and the 5.8 and 8.0 micron time series is detrended\nusing a fit to a calibrator star in the field (see §2.1 & §2.2 for\ndetails.)\n\nread noise and background noise. The time series was\nthen normalized by taking the robust average of out-of-\neclipse points and binned in 6-minute intervals contain-\ning approximately 30 individual measurements each (see\nFig. 2).\nThe 4.5-μm time series also exhibited an initial\nrelaxation-induced brightness increase and consequently\n139 points corresponding to the first ∼30 minutes of ob-\nservations were rejected, which is more points than in\nthe 3.6-μm time series. The analysis of the time series\nwas identical to that of the 3.6-μm time series. The rms\nof out-of-eclipse points was 0.0024, which is 19% higher\n\nTABLE 1\nXO-1 absolute fluxes\n\nIRAC channel XO-1 flux XO-1 instrumental\neffective λ\nmagnitude\n(microns)\n(mag)\n\n(mJy)\n\n3.6\n4.5\n5.8\n8.0\n\n45.1 ± 2.3\n28.5 ± 1.4\n18.1 ± 0.9\n11.7 ± 0.6\n\n9.49\n9.50\n9.51\n9.35\n\nthan the theoretical estimate and is similar to that of\nTrES-1 (rms=0.0027 Charbonneau et al. (2005)).\nWe have tested for the linearity of the detector re-\nsponse in the 3.6 and 4.5 micron channels in which\nXO-1 is close to the onset of detector non-linear re-\nsponse. Using a subset of data from the SAGE survey\n(Meixner et al. 2006) obtained in the high dynamic range\n(HDR) mode of IRAC camera with both 0.6s and 12.0s\nintegration times we are able to determine that both the\n3.6 micron and 4.5 micron XO-1 fluxes are unsaturated\nand in the detector linear regime response. Table 1 shows\nthe absolute XO-1 fluxes and the instrumental magni-\ntudes in the four IRAC channels.\n\n2.2. 5.8 and 8.0 micron time series\n\nThe 5.8 and 8.0 micron time series were recorded with\nSi:As detectors and do not thus exhibit the prominent\nsub-pixel intensity variations evident in the 3.6 micron\nand 4.5 micron channels. The first ∼30 minutes of ob-\nservations (139 data points) were rejected as the instru-\nment settled into a new equilibrium state. Fig. 1 shows\nintensity variation with time, which is caused by changes\nin the effective gain of individual pixels over time. This\neffect has also been been observed by Harrington et al.\n(2007) at 8 micron with IRAC and by Deming et al.\n(2006) at 16 micron with IRS. The intensity variations\nare dependent on the illumination level of the individ-\nual pixel (Knutson et al. 2007, 2008), pixels with high\nillumination will reach their equilibrium within ∼1 hour,\nbut lower illumination pixels increase in intensity over\ntime, approximately proportional to the inverse of the\nlogarithm of illumination. We have decided not to cor-\nrect each pixel in the image as Knutson et al. (2007) have\ndone in their 33-hour observation of HD 189733 in the\n8 micron channel of IRAC and instead fit a combined\nlinear and quadratic logarithm function of time from the\nbeginning of observations to the time series of the bright\ncalibrator 2MASS 16020133+2809268. The fit to the\ntime series of the calibrator was then used to remove the\ndetector ramp from the time series of XO-1 as depicted\nin Fig. 1:\n\nImodel = a1 + a2 × ∆t + a3 × ln∆t + a4 × (ln∆t)2 , (2)\n\nwhere Imodel is the model flux, ∆t is the time since the\nbeginning of observations and ai are the free parameters.\nThe detector ramp intensity decreased in flux during the\n5 hours of observation by ∼ 0.2 %, following a similar\ntrend seen by Knutson et al. (2008) in their 5.8 micron\ntime series of brighter HD 209458b. After removal of the\ndetector ramp and normalization, the rms of unbinned\n5.8 micron out-of-eclipse points for XO-1 was 0.0081,\n\n \n \n \n\f4\n\nMachalek et al.\n\nwhich is 44% higher than theoretical Poisson noise, based\non detector read noise and background noise.9 The nor-\nmalized and binned 5.8 micron time series is depicted in\nFig. 2.\nFitting the detector ramp using a calibrator star, which\nis non-variable at the 0.012 level after detector ramp re-\nmoval, allows us to bypass using XO-1 itself to remove\nthe detector ramp by making a fit to its 5.8 micron out-\nof-eclipse points. The choice whether to correct for the\ndetector ramp of XO-1 using the photometry of a calibra-\ntor star or the target star itself could be a limiting factor\nin our analysis. Deming (2008, p.c.) has indicated that\nin a long (> 10 hours) series of full-frame 12s-exposure\nIRAC photometry, fitting the detector ramp to the tar-\nget star while masking out the points in the eclipse could\nbe more appropriate. We implemented each of the two\nalternate methods of correction, and for these observa-\ntions of XO-1b, the measured depths at 5.8 micron are\nwithin 1-σ of each other.\nCharbonneau et al.\n(2005), Knutson et al.\n(2007),\nHarrington et al. (2007) and Deming et al. (2007) have\nreported a nonlinear flux increase over time in the 8.0 mi-\ncron IRAC channel. We also detect a nonlinear increase\nin the brightness of XO-1 and in the 2 calibrators, in\naddition to the sharp increase during the first ∼30 min-\nutes of observations (137 points). The initial ramp-up\ndata were discarded and the ∼ 1.6% non-linear increase\nof the XO-1 time series over 5 hours (see Fig. 1) was\nremoved by fitting a combined linear and quadratic log-\narithm function (eq. 2) to the time series of the first\ncalibrator 2MASS J16021795+2813328 and dividing the\nXO-1 time series by the fit. The time series was normal-\nized using out-of-eclipse points and binned into 6-minute\nbins (Fig. 2) for viewing clarity. The resulting rms of\nunbinned out-of-eclipse points for the XO-1 time series\nwas 0.0075, 74% above Poisson noise, but similar to that\nof TrES-1 (rms = 0.0085, (Charbonneau et al. 2005)).\n\n3. ANALYSIS\n\nWe fit the secondary eclipse light curves using the for-\nmalism of Mandel & Agol (2002) with no stellar limb\ndarkening and adopt stellar and orbital parameters\n(Holman et al. 2006)10 : R⋆ = 0.928+0.018\n−0.53 degrees, and a =\n0.0488 ± 0.0005 AU with ephemeris (McCullough et al.\n2006)\n\n1.184+0.028\n−0.018 RJ up\n\n11 , i = 89.31+0.46\n\n−0.013 R⊙ , Rp =\n\nTc (E ) = 2, 453, 808.9170(H J D) + E (3.941534 days) .\n(3)\nWe fit the depth of the eclipse ∆F and the timing of\nthe centroid ∆T independently in all 4 channels in the\nunbinned light series using Levenberg-Marquardt mini-\nmization (Press et al. 1992) with an equal error assigned\nto all points, which is equal to the rms of out-of-eclipse\npoints in each time series. Best-fit eclipse curves are\nplotted in Fig. 2 and the eclipse parameters are listed in\nTable 2. They are the channel wavelength, eclipse depth\n\n9 http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/documents/irac_memo.txt\n\n10 We have also reduced the data using the stellar and orbital pa-\nrameters from Torres et al.

The best-fit\neclipse curves are overplotted.\n\n∆F , eclipse mid-center time in HJD, and the timing off-\nset ∆t in minutes from the expected secondary eclipse\nmid-center time for an assumed eccentricity of zero, and\nthe reduced χ2 . The reduced χ2 is close to 1.0 in all 4\nchannels, indicating a good fit to the data.\nTo estimate the errors on the depth and mid-eclipse\ntiming we performed the error analysis using the boot-\nstrap method from Press et al. (1992). The bootstrap\nmethod makes no prior assumptions about the distribu-\ntion of the noise in the data and the data points are not\naltered as in the Monte-Carlo analysis. For 10,000 trial\nruns we have randomly drawn with replacement points\nfrom the normalized- and detector-effect-decorrelated,\nbut otherwise unaltered, light curve, until we had the\nsame number of data points in the light curve that\nwe started with. During each iteration we performed\nthe full eclipse fitting for eclipse depth ∆F and eclipse\nmid-center ∆T . The 1−σ errors for ∆F and ∆T were\ncomputed by fitting a Gaussian to the respective 1-D dis-\ntribution of bootstrap points and are reported in Table 2.\n\n \n \n \n\fXO-1b Thermal emission\n\n5\n\nTABLE 2\nSecondary eclipse best fit parameters\n\nλ\n\n(microns)\n\nEclipse Depth ∆F\n\nEclipse Center Time\n(HJD)\n\nTime offset ∆T\n(min)\n\nReduced χ2\n\n3.6\n4.5\n5.8\n8.0\n\n0.00086 ± 0.00007\n0.00122 ± 0.00009\n0.00261 ± 0.00031\n0.00210 ± 0.00029\n\n2454323.28342 ± 0.00242\n2454193.21175 ± 0.00259\n2454323.29066 ± 0.00488\n2454193.22043 ± 0.00486\n\n-5.42 ± 3.49\n-6.94 ± 3.72\n5.00 ± 7.03\n5.56 ± 7.00\n\n0.76\n0.84\n0.89\n0.99\n\nThe eclipse depth errors ∆F = [0.00007, 0.00009,\n0.00031, 0.00029] for the J = 9.939 XO-1 compare fa-\nvorably with the eclipse depth errors [0.00009, 0.00015,\n0.00043, 0.00026] of Knutson et al. (2008) for the J =\n6.591 HD 209458, despite the fact that XO-1 is dimmer.\nXO-1 observations were made in the full-array mode\nwith 10.4-s integration time and readout time 2.8 s for a\ntotal of 1,620 images, while the HD 209458 observations\nwere made in sub-array mode with exposure time of 0.1\ns in sets of 64 in each channel totaling 26,880 usable\nimages. The S/N scales as ∝ √nexp * fe * ∆t / σtotal ,\nwhere nexp is the number of exposures during the\nduration of the eclipse, fe is the stellar flux in signal\nelectrons, ∆t is the integration time and σtotal is the\ncombined Poisson, readout and background noise. The\npredicted eclipse depth errors for XO-1 in the four IRAC\nchannels are then [0.4; 0.5; 0.9; 2.5] times the respective\neclipse depth errors for the 21 times brighter HD 209458.\n\nTo test the robustness of our data reduction and\nanalysis technique and consistency with other observa-\ntions in the IRAC full-array mode we have re-reduced\nthe 4.5 and 8.0 micron IRAC secondary eclipse data\nof TrES-1 by Charbonneau et al.\n(2005) with our\npipeline, rejecting the first 30 minutes in both channels.\nThe procedure described in §2.1 and §2.2 was used\ntogether with updated stellar and planetary parameters\nof Torres et al. (2008) to derive the eclipse depths\nrelative to the star TrES-1 of ∆F4.5μm = 0.00043 and\n∆F8.0μm = 0.00194, which are -1.1σ and -0.9σ away\nfrom the Charbonneau et al. (2005) secondary eclipse\ndepths of ∆F4.5μm = 0.00057 ± 0.00013 and ∆F8.0μm\n= 0.00225 ± 0.00036, respectively. Our secondary\neclipse [4.5; 8.0]micron channel mid-center timing offsets\nof [+12.5; -2.3] minutes are [-1.1σ ; -2.0σ ] away from\nthe Charbonneau et al. (2005) [4.5; 8.0]micron channel\nvalues +19.6 ± 6.6 min and +8.3 ± 5.2 minutes,\nrespectively. While the eclipse depths are consistent at\nthe ∼ 1-σ level, the eclipse mid-center timing offset in\nthe 8.0 micron channel is only mildly consistent at the\n2.0σ level, probably because Charbonneau et al. (2005)\nobservations were made using multiple Astronomical\nObservation Requests (AORs) which resulted in arbi-\ntrary flux shifts in the time series. Charbonneau et al.\n(2005) do not mention how they have corrected for these\nflux shifts. Despite this fact our pipeline is capable\nof reproducing their results to within ∼ 1-σ in eclipse\ndepth and ∼ 2-σ in mid-eclipse timing. We have thus\ndemonstrated that our reduction pipeline is robust and\nthe secondary eclipse depth estimates are consistent\nwith other ma jor full-array pipelines.\n\n4. DISCUSSION\n\nThe eclipse mid-center timings for XO-1b in Table\n2 are individually consistent with zero timing resid-\nuals for a circular orbit based on the ephemeris by\nMcCullough et al. (2006), but the April and August 2007\ncombined timings show a time shift. The UT Apr 2 2007\nobservations of 4.5 micron and 8.0 micron channels have\na combined eclipse mid-center timing of 2454193.21366 ±\n0.00228 HJD, with a delay of -4.2 ± 3.3 min, while\nthe UT 2007 Aug 10 observations of 3.6 micron and\n5.8 micron channels have a combined center of eclipse\ntime of 2454323.28485 ± 0.00217 HJD, with a delay of\n-3.4 ± 3.1 min. The mid-eclipse timing offsets can be\ninterpreted as evidence for further planets in the sys-\ntem, as can a non-uniform brightness distribution of the\nplanet (which can change the shape of eclipse ingress\nand egress and, thus, shift the eclipse mid-center time\n(Williams et al. 2006)), or as evidence for a non-zero ec-\ncentricity. Using the larger mid-eclipse April time offset,\nthe approximate equation (e.g. Kopal (1959) Eq. 9-23)\n\ne × cos(ω ) ≃\n\nπ∆t\n\n2P\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere e is the eccentricity, ω is the longitude of perias-\ntron, P is the orbital period, and ∆t is the centroid time\nshift from expected time of secondary eclipse, allows us\nto set a 2 σ upper limit on e×cos(ω ) < 0.0024.\nThe XO-1b\neclipse depths in Fig. 3 show several\ntrends. The planet-to-star contrast of XO-1b peaks in\nthe 5.8 μm channel, with a decrease in the 3.6 micron\nand 4.5 micron channel and a slight decrease towards\nthe 8.0 micron channel. Furthermore the flux in the 4.5\nμm channel is higher than in the 3.6 micron channel,\nwhich does not match the general character of the cloud-\nless models of Burrows et al. (2006) for redistribution\nparameter Pn =0.3 (dot-dashed line and open circles\nfor band-averaged ratios in Fig. 3), which predict a\nlower flux at 4.5 microns than at 3.6 microns; the model\nwith thermal inversion predicts the opposite. Since the\nobservations manifest a higher flux in the 4.5 micron\nchannel than at 3.5 micron, a thermal inversion in the\natmosphere might be indicated. Pn=0 corresponds to\nno heat redistribution from the planetary day-side to\nthe night-side and Pn = 0.5 stands for full redistribution\n(see Burrows et al. (2007b) for details). The possibility\nof thermal\ninversion in a planetary atmosphere has\nbeen suggested by Hubeny et al. (2003), Burrows et al.\n(2006, 2007a) and Fortney et al. (2007).\nRecently,\nBurrows et al. (2007a,b) suggested that model spectra\ncould match the observations of HD 209458b and\nHD 149026b if a stratospheric absorber of unknown\ncomposition (possibly tholins, polyacetylenes, TiO or\n\n\f6\n\nMachalek et al.\n\nVO) were present in the atmosphere of the planet.\nThe presence of a stratospheric absorber would yield a\nthermal inversion in the planetary atmosphere and the\npresence of the water features in emission for a variety\nof heat redistribution parameters Pn .\n\n0.0040\n\n0.0030\n\n0.0020\n\no\n\ni\nt\n\na\n\nr\n\nx\nu\n\nl\nf\n\nr\n\na\n\nt\n\ns\n\n/\n\nt\n\ne\nn\na\n\nl\n\nP\n\n0.0010\n\n0.0000\n2\n\n        1600K\n\n        1200K\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\nWavelength μm\n\n10\n\n12\n\nFig. 3.- Spitzer Space Telescope IRAC secondary eclipse depths\n\nfor XO-1b with bootstrap error bars (filled squares). The pre-\ndicted emission spectrum of the planet with an upper atmospheric\nabsorber of κe = 0.1 cm2 /g and a redistribution parameter of\nPn=0.3 is plotted as a solid line. A model with no atmospheric\nabsorber and a redistribution parameter of Pn=0.3 is over plotted\nwith dot-dashed line (see §3 for details). The band-averaged flux\nratios are plotted as open squares and open circles for the models\nwith and without stratospheric absorber, respectively. The normal-\nized Spitzer Space Telescope IRAC response curves for the 3.6-, 4.5-\n, 5.8-, and 8.0 micron channels are plotted at the bottom of the fig-\nure (doted lines). The theoretical flux ratios obtained from a XO-1\n\nstellar spectrum (from http://kurucz.harvard.edu/stars/XO1/ )\n\nand an assumed black-body spectrum for the planet at [1200, 1600]\nK are plotted as dashed lines.\n\nOur observations suggest the presence of a thermal\ninversion layer and a possible stratospheric absorber\nin the atmosphere of the XO-1b planet. The solid line\nand open squares in Fig. 3 depict an atmospheric model\nof XO-1b, following the methodology of Burrows et al.\n(2006, 2007a) with a thermal inversion and a strato-\nspheric absorber of opacity of κe = 0.1 cm2/g and\nredistribution parameter of Pn = 0.3. The latter model\nfits the data better than the canonical cloudless model\nwith Pn = 0.3 (dot-dashed curve and open circles for\naveraged band ratios). The band-averaged flux ratios\nfor the model with a stratospheric absorber (open\nsquares) are within the error bars for the 3.6, 4.5, and\n8.0 micron channels, but are inconsistent by 2.7σ with\nthe band-averaged flux ratios for the 5.8 micron channel.\nThis is similar to the situation for the IRAC fit to the\nobservations by HD 209458b by Knutson et al. (2008).\nThe absorber-free canonical model (dot-dashed line)\nis clearly inconsistent with our observations (Fig. 3)\nof XO-1b in all 4 channels by [3.4σ , 7.1σ , 6.3σ , 3.7σ ],\nrespectively.\n\nBurrows et al. (2007b) and Fortney et al. (2007) sug-\ngested that the presence of the stratospheric absorber\nmight be correlated with the incident flux from the\nstar at the sub-stellar point on the planet, the precise\nlevel of which is yet to be refined. The presence of\nan irradiation-induced stratospheric absorber has been\n\nsuggested by Burrows et al. (2007a) for HD 209458b\n(see our Fig. 4) with a sub-stellar flux of ∼1.07 × 109\nerg cm −2 s −1 at a distance a = 0.045 AU. Interestingly,\nXO-1b has a lower sub-stellar flux of ∼ 0.49 × 109 erg\ncm −2 s −1 and a semi-ma jor axis of a = 0.0488 AU,\nbut still manifests evidence for a thermal inversion. A\nrecent study of the broadband infrared spectrum of\nHD 189733b (see our Fig. 4) by Charbonneau et al.\n(2008) finds no evidence for an atmospheric thermal\ninversion, despite a similar sub-stellar point flux of ∼\n0.47 × 109 erg cm −2 s −1 (Burrows et al. 2007b) with a\nsmaller semi-ma jor axis a = 0.0313 AU. Further study\nof planetary atmospheres should refine the concept of\nthis sub-stellar flux boundary with respect to the pres-\nence/absence of a stratospheric absorber and thermal\ninversion.\n\nXO-1b\nHD 209458b\nHD 189733b\nGJ 436b\nTrES-1\nHD 149026b\n\n0.0040\n\n0.0030\n\n0.0020\n\no\n\ni\nt\n\na\n\nr\n\nx\nu\n\nl\nf\n\nr\n\na\n\nt\n\ns\n\n/\n\nt\n\ne\nn\na\n\nl\n\nP\n\n0.0010\n\n0.0000\n2\n\n4\n\n6\nWavelength μm\n\n8\n\n10\n\nFig. 4.- Comparison of Spitzer Space Telescope IRAC secondary\n\neclipse depths: XO-1b (filled square) from this paper; HD 209458b\n(filled circle) from Knutson et al.

The normalized Spitzer Space\nTelescope IRAC response curves for the 3.6-, 4.5-, 5.8-, and 8.0 mi-\ncron channels are plotted at the bottom of the figure (doted lines).\n\nAtmospheric water detection has been claimed in\nthe transit broadband spectra of HD 189733b by\nTinetti et al. (2007) and in its secondary eclipse spec-\ntra by Fortney & Marley (2007). Burrows et al. (2007a)\nalso found evidence for water vapor emission in the at-\nmosphere of HD 209458b. Our data can be interpreted as\nevidence for rovibrational band of water emission long-\nward of ∼4.0 microns, which manifests itself as a flux\nenhancement in Fig. 3 compared to the cloudless model.\nThe depth of the flux ratio trough near the 3.6 micron\nchannel in the atmospheric models with stratospheric ab-\nsorber strongly depends on the redistribution parameter\nPn (Burrows et al. (2007b), especially their Fig. 4). Fur-\nther modeling would allow tighter constraints on the Pn ,\nnot just for XO-1b, but for a variety of planets. The\nfortuitous importance of the 3.6 micron IRAC channel\nto the study of planetary atmospheres is likely to be en-\nhanced as the Spitzer Space Telescope runs out of cryo-\ncoolant in 2009, when only the 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron\nchannels will be available.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fXO-1b Thermal emission\n\n7\n\n5. CONCLUSION\n\nWe report the estimated flux ratios of the planet XO-\n1b in the Spitzer Space Telescope IRAC 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and\n8.0-μm channels. We find that the estimated fluxes are\nnot consistent with a canonical cloudless model for ther-\nmal emission from the planet and instead may indicate\nan atmosphere with as yet unknown stratospheric ab-\nsorber and a likely thermal inversion, which would cause\nthe water band longward of 4.0 microns to switch from\nabsorption to emission. The atmospheric model with a\nthermal inversion produces a tight match to the data at\n3.6, 4.5, and 8.0 microns, but is inconsistent by 2.7σ with\nobservations at 5.8 microns. This is similar to observa-\ntions of HD 209458b (Knutson et al. 2008).\nThe presence or absence of the stratospheric absorber\nand thermal inversion layer has been linked to the flux\nfrom the parent star at the sub-stellar point on the\nplanet. The XO-1b sub-stellar point flux of ∼0.49 ×\n109 erg cm −2 s −1 is the lowest so far reported for a\nplanetary atmosphere with a thermal inversion. Obser-\nvations of atmospheres of other planets may permit a\nbetter understanding of the thermal inversion layer and\nparametrization of the characteristics that create such a\nthermal inversion.\n\nThe authors would like\nto thank J.
