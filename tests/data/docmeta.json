  "abstract": "Given $\\beta>0$ and $\\delta>0$, the function $t^{-\\beta}$ may be approximated for $t$ in a compact interval $[\\delta,T]$ by a sum of terms of the form $we^{-at}$, with parameters $w>0$ and $a>0$. One such an approximation, studied by Beylkin and Monz\\'on, is obtained by applying the trapezoidal rule to an integral representation of $t^{-\\beta}$, after which Prony's method is applied to reduce the number of terms in the sum with essentially no loss of accuracy. We review this method, and then describe a similar approach based on an alternative integral representation. The main difference is that the new approach achieves much better results before the application of Prony's method; after applying Prony's method the performance of both is much the same.",
