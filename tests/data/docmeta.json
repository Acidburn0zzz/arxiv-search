One such an approximation, studied by Beylkin and Monz\\'on, is obtained by applying the trapezoidal rule to an integral representation of $t^{-\\beta}$, after which Prony's method is applied to reduce the number of terms in the sum with essentially no loss of accuracy. We review this method, and then describe a similar approach based on an alternative integral representation. The main difference is that the new approach achieves much better results before the application of Prony's method; after applying Prony's method the performance of both is much the same.","title":"Exponential sum approximations for $t^{-\\beta}$","journal_ref":null,"proxy":null,"submitter":{"is_author":true,"email":"w.mclean@unsw.edu.au","orcid":"0000-0002-7133-2884","name":"William McLean","name_utf8":"William McLean"},"paper_id":"1606.00123","source":{"flags":"","format":"pdftex","size_bytes":78752},"title_utf8":"Exponential sum approximations for $t^{-β}$","submitted_date":"2017-06-06T22:07:47-0400","abs_categories":"math.NA","metadata_id":1948698,"acm_class":null,"report_num":null,"version":3,"abstract_utf8":"Given $β>0$ and $δ>0$, the function $t^{-β}$ may be approximated for $t$ in a compact interval $[δ,T]$ by a sum of terms of the form $we^{-at}$, with parameters $w>0$ and $a>0$.
