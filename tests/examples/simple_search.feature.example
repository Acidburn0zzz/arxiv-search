Feature: Simple Search

  Users should be able to enter terms and expressions into a basic search box.
  Users should also be able to select from a simple list of metadata in which
  to search. A list of results is generated containing the results across the
  metadata fields selected.

  Scenario: simple term search across all fields
    Given search term is "flux capacitor"
    And selected field to search is "All fields"
    When a user performs a search
    Then a list of results is displayed
    And all entries contain a metadata field that contains "flux"
    And all entries contain a metadata field that contains "capacitor"

  Scenario: search for TeX terms
    This could be a scenario for any of the search forms and is a test of how
    and whether the TeX tokenizing works.
    A search for a TeX expression should match similar metadata strings.
    Note, I am not sure if this is supposed to happen:
    This "$z$" also produces results for "z" (not wrapped in TeX)
    "Î»" produces no results but "lambda" and "$\lambda$" do

    Given search entry is "$z_1$"
    And selected field to search is "All fields"
    When a user performs a search
    Then a list of results is displayed
    And all entries contain a metadata field that contains the expression "z_1"
